"""Utility helpers for common I/O operations.

This module currently provides a small collection of helper functions used
across the project.  They intentionally have **no** thirdâ€‘party dependencies
other than :mod:`pandas` and standard library modules so that they can be used
from many contexts (tests, plugins, etc.).

Functions
~~~~~~~~~

``expand``
    Perform a simple ``str.format`` expansion on a path template.
``file_hash``
    Compute a SHA256 hash for a file, streaming the contents to avoid loading
    the entire file into memory.
``write_excel``
    Write a :class:`pandas.DataFrame` to an Excel file, creating any parent
    directories as required.
